# Globalizing DITA content

The DITA standard supports content that is written in or translated to any language. In general, DITA Open Toolkit passes content through to the output format unchanged. DITA-OT uses the values for the `@xml:lang` and `@dir` attributes that are set in the source content to provide globalization support. You can create custom plug-ins to support additional languages.
