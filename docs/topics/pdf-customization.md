# Customizing PDF output

You can adjust various aspects of PDF output by changing parameter settings or using a theme file. For more complex customizations, you can create custom DITA-OT plug-ins.

For example:

-   To print the file names of the graphics underneath figures, set **args.artlbl** to yes.
-   To disable the subsection links on the first page of each chapter, set **args.chapter.layout** to BASIC.
-   To change the name of the PDF file to something other than the input map name, set **outputFile.base** to the desired file name \(without the `.pdf` extension\).

**Note:** For the full list of settings for PDF output, see [PDF parameters](../parameters/parameters-pdf.md).
