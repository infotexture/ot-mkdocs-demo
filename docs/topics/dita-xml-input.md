# Standard DITA XML

DITA Open Toolkit supports all released versions of the OASIS DITA specification, including 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. As of release 4.0, DITA-OT also provides an initial preview of features for the latest draft of the upcoming DITA 2.0 standard.

The DITA specification “defines a set of document types for authoring and organizing topic-oriented information, as well as a set of mechanisms for combining, extending, and constraining document types.” The [DITA 1.3 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/dita-v1.3-part0-overview.html) is the authoritative source of information on authoring DITA content in XML.

**Tip:** For details on how DITA Open Toolkit processes DITA XML content, see [DITA specification support](../reference/dita-spec-support.md).
