# Adding and removing plug-ins

You can extend DITA-OT with additional plug-ins to change the default output types in various ways, add entirely new kinds of output formats, or implement DITA specializations. A variety of open source plug-ins are available from the plug-in registry at [dita-ot.org/plugins](https://www.dita-ot.org/plugins).
