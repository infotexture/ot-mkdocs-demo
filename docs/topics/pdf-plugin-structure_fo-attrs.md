# Custom attributes

The `fo/attrs` folder houses custom attribute configuration files that override the standard attributes in `org.dita.pdf2/cfg/fo/attrs`.

These files define the appearance of different elements in XML assets when they are rendered to PDF output. The different DITA elements are organized into files by element type â€“ index-related definitions in `index-attr.xsl`, table-related definitions in `tables-attr.xsl`, etc.

The XSL attribute sets defined in these files can be used to override the presentation of DITA elements, including font size, color, spacing, etc.
