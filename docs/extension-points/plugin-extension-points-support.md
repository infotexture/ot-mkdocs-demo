# Version and support information

You can use these extension points to define version and support information for a plug-in. Currently, DITA-OT does not do anything with this information, but it might do so in the future.

-   **__package.support.name__**

    Specifies the person who provides support for the DITA-OT plug-in.

-   **__package.support.email__**

    Specifies the e-mail address of the person who provides support for the DITA-OT plug-in.

-   **__package.version__**

    Specifies the version of the DITA-OT plug-in.

    The value uses the following syntax:

    ```
    *major*.*minor*.*micro*.*qualifier*
    ```

    where:

    -   *major* is a number and is required.
    -   *minor* is a number and is optional.
    -   *micro* is a number and is optional.
    -   *qualifier* is optional and can be composed of numerals, uppercase or lower case letters, underscores, and hyphens.
    By default, the **package.version** value is set to `0.0.0`.


## Example

```
<plugin id="com.example.WithSupportInfo">
  <feature extension="package.support.name" value="Joe the Author"/>
  <feature extension="package.support.email" value="joe@example.com"/>
  <feature extension="package.version" value="1.2.3"/>
</plugin>
```
